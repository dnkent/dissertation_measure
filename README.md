# R Code for Dissertation Chapter 1: "Measuring International Dissatisfaction"

This repository includes four folders. The first's code builds international networks and estimates descriptive statistics for each.
The second ranks states by their CINC scores for each year. The third trains a machine learning model on CINC scores that predicts MID outcomes.
The fourth combines the the estimates produced in other folders to build an estimate of each state's international dissatisfaction from 1816-2012.
